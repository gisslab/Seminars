    \begin{wideitemize}
    \item In 1981 a bank could only operate in their home state or county.
    \item Deregulation process started in the 1980s with voluntary reciprocal interstate agreements.
    \item 1994 Riegle-Neal Act: banks could operate across state lines.

    %We next highlight the nature of bank branch expansion across the bank size distribution. For a given size group $g$, in terms of total deposits, we first calculate the total number of branches in each size group. We then separate growth in the number of branches into an intensive and extensive margin, namely,
    For size group $g$, in terms of total deposits, branch growth is:
$$
\Delta \log \left(\text { branches }_{g t}\right)=\underbrace{\Delta \log (\text { branches per county })_{g t}}_{\text {intensive margin growth }}+\underbrace{\Delta \log (\text { counties })_{g t}}_{\text {extensive margin growth }} .

    % 3.3 Sorting and the Determinants of Firms' Footprints

% In the model, four distinct forces determine a bank's geographic footprint. First, banks are likely to place branches close to headquarters since this directly increases their appeal. Second, "span-of-control sorting" says that more productive banks sort into denser more expensive locations, while less productive banks open branches in less attractive, but cheaper, markets. Third, "mismatch sorting" says that banks choose locations based on the match of the location's characteristics to the funding needs of the bank. We discuss each in turn in this subsection. Finally, a bank's incentives to invest in its appeal to borrowers and depositors determine the bank's size, but also the value of entering different locations. We study this last force in the final subsection.

        % Before we present our main result on "span-of-control" sorting, we show that more productive banks have higher marginal span-of-control costs, $\sigma_j$, and, under Assumption 1, the difference is larger than their difference in deposit and loan productivities.

        \item \textcolor{blue}{Lemma 3:} Consider two banks with the same headquarters location and the same local taste shocks, $\left\{\phi_{j \ell}\right\}$. Bank 2 is equally more productive than Bank 1, so $z_2^D / z_1^D=z_2^L / z_1^L>1$. Then $\sigma_2>\sigma_1$ and, if Assumption 1 holds, $\sigma_2 / \sigma_1>z_2^D / z_1^D=z_2^L / z_1^L$.

For locations with higher local exogenous fixed costs, the more productive bank operates more branches; for locations with lower local fixed costs, the less productive firm operates more plants. This form of sorting arises due to the span-of-control costs. While the more productive (or more appealing) bank would earn higher profits per branch in any location, the more productive firm also has a higher marginal span-of-control cost from operating an additional branch. As a result, a given percentage difference in the exogenous fixed cost across locations implies a smaller proportional change in a large bank's total fixed cost.

As the deregulation picked up, there is a clear decline, culminating at the 0.22 level following the passage of the IBBEA, when all states deregulated fully.

            $$
            \log \left(\text { Density }_{j s t}\right)=\beta \operatorname{Size}_{j t}+\sum_{\substack{-5 \leq h \leq 10 \\ h \neq-1}} \beta_h \operatorname{Size}_{j t} \times \text { Open }_{s t+h}+\gamma_{s t}+\varepsilon_{j s t},
            $$
            where $\operatorname{Open}_{s t+h}$ is equal to 1 if $\operatorname{Recip}_{s t+h}>0$, $h=0$ the first period in which a state opened up.
        \end{itemize}
    %Of course, we cannot rule out that the estimation may be simply picking up pre-trends in sorting patterns. Many states deregulated in-state branching in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which could drive changes in sorting patterns as banks became less geographically constrained within a given state. %We therefore further test for causality by looking at the dynamic effects of deregulation on sorting. We estimate an event study specification given by
    % $$
    % \log \left(\text { Density }_{j s t}\right)=\beta \operatorname{Size}_{j t}+\sum_{\substack{-5 \leq h \leq 10 \\ h \neq-1}} \beta_h \operatorname{Size}_{j t} \times \text { Open }_{s t+h}+\gamma_{s t}+\varepsilon_{j s t},
    % $$
    % where $\operatorname{Open}_{s t+h}$ is an indicator equal to 1 if $\operatorname{Recip}_{s t+h}>0$. We let $h=0$ refer to the first period in which a state opened up to any other state. 
    %If the results in Table III are driven by changes in sorting induced by intra-state branching deregulation, then the pre-trend coefficients $(h<0)$ should be positive.
    
    % Figure 11 plots the results of the event study. The pre-trend coefficients average 0.01 and are all statistically insignificant at the $5 \%$ level. All of the post-opening coefficients are negative, and only the initial deregulation year is insignificant. The effects are monotonically declining over time following the initial opening, which likely reflects the increasing degree of openness over time.

The final step is to explore what was the effect of this expansion on the dynamics of a bank's overall reliance on wholesale funding after the deregulation shock. We do this by studying the dynamics of the deregulation shock on a bank's geographic expansion and wholesale funding reliance as a function of the bank's initial size and wholesale funding use. Let Large ${ }_j$ be an indicator equal to 1 if bank $j$ is in the top $5 \%$ of banks by deposits in the first sample year, 1984. Given an outcome variable $Y_{j t}$, we estimate

        % for $h=1, \ldots, 7 $ 
        %We consider the relative effect of differential use of wholesale funding, $\mathrm{WFE}_{j t}$ and $\mathrm{WFE}_{j^{\prime} t}$, for two banks with identical expansion options, $\operatorname{Recip}_{j t}=$ Recip $_{j^{\prime} t}$, in an identical size bin, Large $_j=$ Large $_{j^{\prime}}$. The differential effect on outcome $Y_{(\cdot)}$ at horizon $h$ of total deregulation, Recip ${ }_{j t}=1$, is then given by $\left[\beta_{1 h}+\beta_{3 h}\right.$ Large $\left._j\right]\left(\mathrm{WFE}_{j t}-\mathrm{WFE}_{j^{\prime} t}\right)$. We consider three dependent variables: wholesale funding exposure, total branches, and total counties with at least one branch. We plot the effects for each measure given a one standard deviation increase in wholesale funding for small (below top $5 \%$ in deposits) and large (above top $5 \%$ in deposits) banks. The standard deviations of wholesale funding are 0.099 and 0.149 , respectively.

We progressively include controls in the regression, such as county per-capita income and the number of local banks and branches. We also consider a specification with state-year fixed effects to control for differences in financial development across states and to better connect the results to the sorting regressions in the previous section.
